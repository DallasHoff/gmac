My training focus for myself and my clients is on functional fitness for every day strength and endurance and quality of life.  Do you want to get through your day with energy to spare? Be strong and independent?  Shape up your shape? Improve your balance and protect your joints?  Let me help you to live the fit life!

If you want to train with a partner - we can do that too! 

Give me a call or text and we'll set up a time to meet and talk about your goals.

(I am also available for training at [URMC Wellness Center](https://www.wellnessurmc.org/) in Thomaston on Tuesday, Thursday evenings and Friday morning. You must be a member and sign up for personal training.)
