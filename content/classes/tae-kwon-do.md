**Tae Kwon-Do** is a popular martial art and international sport. It is the most practiced martial art in the world. Korean masters brought Tae Kwon-Do to the United States in the 1950’s. Introduced as a demonstration event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Tae Kwon-Do became a full medal Olympic competition sport at the 2000 games in Sydney Australia. Tae Kwon-Do is a stand-up martial art like karate, kungfu, and kickboxing that emphasizes defending oneself while staying on your feet. It teaches kicking, blocking, hand techniques, forms, balance, and discipline of the body and mind.

**Griffin Tae Kwon-Do** meets on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays and welcomes students from age six to adult and encourages the whole family to give it a try! The Hoffman family all earned their belts together, and the family that spars together wins together! But if you just want to bring the kids and watch them grow in skills and confidence- that’s fine too!

To try out a class, give Eric a call and let him know when you’re coming. For your first class, wear comfortable gym clothes and don’t worry about your shoes since Tae Kwon-Do, like most martial arts, is practiced barefoot.
