Tang Soo Do is a traditional Korean martial arts style derived from Karate and similar to TaeKwonDo as a standup martial art emphasizing kicks and punches. It is also a sport martial art and therefore sparring is light contact or no contact. There are also weapons demonstration forms using the bow staff, sword or knife.

Dr Michelle Worth has many years experience teaching martial arts. Her Tang Soo Do program is a Christian-based program which includes Bible verse memorization and values chats, as well as forms, sparring, and self-defense. It is appropriate for the whole family.

Every first Saturday of the month Michelle holds a Momfu self-defense class for women only.
