Tang Soo Do is a traditional Korean martial arts style derived from Karate and similar to Tae Kwon Do as a standup martial art emphasizing kicks and punches. It is also a sport martial art and therefore sparring is light contact or no contact. There are also weapons demonstration forms using the bow staff, sword or knife.
