Tai chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that, today, is practiced as a graceful form of exercise. It involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing.

Tai chi, also called tai chi chuan, is a system of gentle physical exercise and stretching. Each posture flows into the next without pause, ensuring that your body is in constant motion. The slow focused movement patterns and deep breathing are also called moving meditation. The health benefits of meditation are well-known.

When practiced regularly and correctly, tai chi can be a meaningful part of improving your health. The benefits of tai chi may include:

* Decreased stress, anxiety and depression
* Improved mood
* Improved aerobic capacity
* Increased energy and stamina
* Improved flexibility, balance and agility
* Improved muscle strength and definition\
