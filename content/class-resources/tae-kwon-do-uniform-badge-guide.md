## Adding Badges

**Important Note**: Put the uniform *on* the student and properly tie closed *before* pinning the badges in place. If the patches are pinned on without the uniform being properly tied, the front badges will be crooked when the uniform is worn.

1. **American flag**: centered on right shoulder, 1½ inch below shoulder seam.
2. **Korean flag**: centered on left shoulder, 1½ inch below shoulder seam.
3. **Griffin Tae Kwon-Do badge**: centered on right breast.
4. **United Tae Kwon-Do Federation badge**: centered on left breast.

Pin the badges in place, and ensure that they are in the correct positions. Then, sew them down.
